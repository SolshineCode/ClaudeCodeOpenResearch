# Project 1 - Claude Context

## Project Focus

AI Document Intelligence & LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Games

## Scope

This project explores the intersection of:
- **Document Intelligence**: How LLMs parse, understand, and reason about structured documents
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Probing the internal mechanisms by which models process information
- **Interactive Games**: Structured challenges that reveal model behavior and capabilities

## Working Guidelines

1. Focus on this project folder only - ignore sibling project folders
2. Experiments should be reproducible and well-documented
3. Prioritize insights that could generalize across models and document types
4. Build tools that make interpretability accessible and interactive

## Key Research Questions

- How do attention patterns shift when processing different document structures?
- Can we design "games" that reliably surface specific model behaviors?
- What probing techniques best reveal document understanding mechanisms?
- How can we make interpretability findings actionable for practitioners?
