# ClaudeCodeOpenResearch

This repository serves as a central location for **different open research experiments using Claude Code**.

## Repository Structure

Each distinct research project lives in its own folder within this repository. Projects are independent and self-contained.

## Protocol

1. **Create a new folder** for each new research experiment
2. **Ignore other project folders** when working on a specific project - treat each as isolated
3. Each project folder should contain its own `README.md` and `claude.md` with project-specific context
4. Keep experiments modular and independent to avoid cross-contamination of ideas and code

## Current Projects

- `Project 1/` - AI Document Intelligence & LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Games
